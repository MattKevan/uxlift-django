They are held in cities up and down the M62: Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds, Newcastle and our newest group in York.\n\nThese meetings are completely free and open to anyone who’s interested in user experience, whatever work you do or discipline you study. And if you’d like to speak at one, you’re very welcome – we want to encourage as many people as possible to take part.\n\n### Why not try our…\n\n…[NUX conference](http://nuxconf.uk/). Our annual conference is growing in numbers and in influence – we run it right here in the North, finding national and international speakers who want to share what they have learned. It’s big and exciting, and it’s just as friendly as our monthly get-togethers",

We go further to ensure our students forge careers which afford them purpose, autonomy and creativity—ultimately landing jobs which genuinely improve their quality of life. This is what drives us to keep honing and perfecting everything we do, every day.\n\nWe know how technology can enrich the educational experience of our students—but we also know that it’s the human relationships which really make the difference. With our unparalleled level of support and superior curricula, we’ve set out to prove that online study can be more personal, more engaging and more effective than in-person study—and that, with the right support, no one gets left behind.\n\nOur graduates get hired. For every job landed, every life changed, we come to work with ever more spring in our step. Each student takes their own unique journey, but the outcome is universal: a more fulfilling career—and a skills gap that’s just that little bit smaller.",
